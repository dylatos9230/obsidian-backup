- In reality WebGL is[[ just a rasterization engine]].
- It draws points, lines, and triangles based on code you supply.
- Getting WebGL to do anything else is up to you to provide code to use [[point, line, and triangles]] to accomplish your task.
- You need to provide the code in the form of pairs of functions that runs on the GPU.
