 ## Dynamic power
 #### Definition
- Dynamic power is the power used to charge capacitance as signals change between 0 and 1.
#### Consumption
- The energy drawn from the power supply to charge a capacitance C to voltage Vdd is CVdd ^ 2 .
- If the voltage on the capacitor switches at frequency f (i.e., f times per second), it charges the capacitor f/2 times and discharges it f/2 times per second. Discharging does not draw energy from the power supply
