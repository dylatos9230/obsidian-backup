## Movtivation
- CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics) "Power (physics)") is consumed, except when the inputs to [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate "Logic gate") are being switched.

- [[One-Input NOT Gate]]
- [[Two-Input NAND Gate]]
- [[Two-Input AND Gate]]
- [[Tow-Input NOR Gate]]
- [[Transmission Gates]]
- [[General CMOS Gate Structure]]
