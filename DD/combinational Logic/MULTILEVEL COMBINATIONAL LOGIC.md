## Motivation
- Logic in sum-of-products form is called two-level logic because it consists of literals connected to a level of AND gates connected to a level of OR gates
- But the multilevel combinational circuits may use less hardware than their two-level counterparts.
- [[Bubble pushing]] is especially helpful in analyzing and designing multilevel curcuits
