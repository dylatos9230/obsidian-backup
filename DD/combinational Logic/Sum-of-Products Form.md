## Definition
- A truth table of N inputs contains 2^N rows, one for each possible value of the inputs. 
- Each row in a truth table is associated with a minterm that is TRUE for that row.
- We can write a Boolean equation for any truth table by summing each of the minterms for which the output, Y, is TRUE.
