1. The pMOS transistors consists of [[P-type ]]source and drain regions in [[N-type]] semiconductor substrate 
2. pMOS transistors work in just the opposite fashion to the nMOS. The substrate is tied to Vdd. When the gate is also at Vdd, the pMOS transistor is OFF. When the gate is at GND, the channel inverts to p-type and the pMOS is ON
