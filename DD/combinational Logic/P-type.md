  1. On the other hand, if a group III dopant such as Aluminum (Al) is added, the dopant atoms are missing an electron

 2. The  missing electron is called a hole. An electron from a neighboring silicon atom may move over to fill the missing bond, forming  an ionized dopant atom (Al-) and leaving a hole at the neighboring silicon atom

3. The hole is a lack of negative charge, so it acts like a positively charged particle. Hence, we call Al a P-type dopant.
