## Terminology
- The *complement* of a variable A is its inverse A
- The variable or its complement is called a *literal*
- The AND of one or more literals is called a *product* or an *implicant*
- A *minterm* is a product involving all of the inputs to the function
- The OR of one or more literals is called a *sum* 
- A *maxterm* is a sum involving all of the inputs to the function.
- The order of operations is important when interpreting Boolean equations
	- NOT has the highest *precedence*, followed by AND, then OR
	- Just as in ordinary equations, products are performed before sums. 
	- NOT>AND>OR
