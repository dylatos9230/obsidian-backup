1. A capacitor consists of two conductors separated by an insulator.
2. When a voltage V is applied to one of the conductor, the conductor accumulates electric charge Q and the other conductor accumulates the opposite charge -Q.
3. The capacitance is proportional to the size of the conductors and inversely proportional to the distance between them.
4. Capacitance's charging or discharging a conductor takes time and energy which extremely related to the speed and energy of a circuit
