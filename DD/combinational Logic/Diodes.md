1. Putting p-type and n-type silicon together  is called a p-n junction. 
2. The extra electrons belonged to N-type will want to drift to the p-type crystal for filling the holes.
3. Over time, an electric field will be generated across the P-N Junction, it's going to be difficult for new electrons to cross the P-N Junction.

4.  The electrons on the right still want to fill these holes on the P-type. so they still feel a force that wants to accelerate them towards the left, meanwhile, however they're repelled by the force of negative charge. 
5.  When these two forces reach a state of equilibrium, electrons no longer across the P-N Junction and so this is going to lead to a constant Junction potential

6. The p-type region is called the anode and the n-type region is called the catbode

 7. When the voltage on the anode rises above the voltage on the cathode, the diode is forward biased, and current flows through the diode from the anode to the cathode.
 8. But when the anode voltage is lower than the voltage on the cathode, the diode is reverse biased, and no current flows
