## Binary Encoding (Full Encoding)
- With **binary encoding**, as was used in the traffic light controller example, each state is represented as a binary number.
- Because **K** binary numbers can be represented by log2K bits, a system with K states only needs log2K bits of state.
- Use the minimum number of bits used to encode all states.
- **Minimizes** # flip-flop, but not neccesarily output logic or next state logic.
