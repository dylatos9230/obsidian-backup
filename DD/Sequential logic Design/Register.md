## Introduction
- An N-bit register is a bank of N flip-flops that share a common CLK input, so that all bits of the register are updated at the same time.
## Schematic
- The diagram below shows the schematic and symbol for a four-bit register with inputs D3:0 and outputs Q3:0 are both 4-bit busses.
