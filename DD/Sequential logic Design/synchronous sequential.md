## Introduction
- In general, sequential circuits include all circuits those whose output cannot be determined simply by looking at the current inputs.
- A sequential circuit has a finite set of discrete states { S0, S1, ..., Sk-1 }  
- A sysnchronous equential circuit has a clock input, whose rising edges indicate a sequence of times at which state transitions occur.
