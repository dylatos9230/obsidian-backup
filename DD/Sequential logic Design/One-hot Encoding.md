- Only one bit is "hot" or TRUE at any time.
- Each bit of state is stored in a flip-flop, so **one-hot encoding** requires more flip-flops than **binary encoding**.
- But with one-hot encoding, the next-state and output logic is often simpler, so fewer gates are required.
- Each bit encodes a different state.
- Simplest design process - very automatable.
- The best encoding choice depends on the specific FSM.
- Maximizes # flip-flops, minimizes next state logic.
