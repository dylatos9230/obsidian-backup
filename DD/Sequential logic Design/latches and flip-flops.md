## Introduction
- One of the simplest sequential circuits is the [[SR Latch]], which is composed of two cross-coupled NOR gates.
- The S and R inputs conflate the issues of what and when. The [[D Latch]] solves these problems.
- The [[D Flip-Flop]] can update the state only at a specific instant in time
- An N-bit [[Register]] is a bank of N flip-flops that are the key building block of most sequential circuits
- [[Enabled Flip-Flop]] are useful when we wish to load a new value inot a flip-flop only some of the time, rather than on every clock edge.
- [[Resettable Flip-Flop]] are useful when we want to force a known state into all the flip-flops in a system when we first turn it on.
