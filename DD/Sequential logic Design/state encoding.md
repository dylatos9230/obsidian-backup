## Introduction
- Unfortunately, there is no simple way to find the best encoding except to try all possibilities, which is infeasible when the number of states is large.
- However, it is often possible to choose a good encoding by inspection, so that related states or outputs share bits.
- Computer-aid design tools  are also good at searching the set of possible encodings and selecting a reasonable one.
## Choices
- [[Binary Encoding]] 
- [[One-hot Encoding]]
- [[Output Encoding]]
