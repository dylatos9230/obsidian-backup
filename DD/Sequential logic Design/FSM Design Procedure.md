- **Determine** all possible states of your  machine
- **Develop** a **state transition diagram**
	- Generally this is done from a textual description
	- You need to 
		- 1) determine the inputs and outputs for each state and 
		- 2) figure out how to get from one state to another
- Approach
	- Start by defining the **reset state** and what happens from it - this is typically an easy point to start from
	- Then continue to add **transitions** and **states**
	- Picking **good state names** is very important
	- Building an FSM is like programming(but it is not programming)
		- An FSM has a sequential "control-flow" like a program with conditionals and goto's
		- The if-then-else construct is controlled by one or more inputs
		- The outputs are controlled by the state or the inputs
	- In hardware, we typically have many concurrent FSMs.
