- Loss is a function of parameters 
 ![[Pasted image 20210325011215.png]]
 - Loss is defined for getting how good a set of parameters is.
 - For example, **L(0.5k, 1)** => ** y = b + wx1** => **y = 0.5k + 1x1 **
 - Calculate the **e** by substracting the predicted value and the label value each other.
 - All of the **e** will be handled with a sort of statistical methods. Say:

	 - MAE (Mean absolute error)

	 - MSE (Mean square error)
	 ![[Pasted image 20210325013422.png]]
	 - If y and hat y are both probability distributions, we could us the **Cross-entropy**
	- Draw the error surface
